# type-single-page
 
 With this project, I worked to create a type specimen for the font Condor by David Jonathan Ross. Using both HTML and CSS, I built up the one-page site. Similar to the Art Deco movement that inspired the font originally, I used its look to create my site. I used SVG files, Links, a navigation bar, and CSS grid to create this site effectively. Learning to use these aspects of coding was difficult but it helped me learn more and understand other aspects of CSS that I wasnâ€™t yet comfortable with. Figma was a big help during this project as well. I used it to create my designs and backgrounds for the header and many of the other sections. This way I could export them as SVGs and fill out much of my page without worrying about the code. For hours I worked to get my idea on Figma and I fully believe It allowed me to get the look I wanted with HTML and CSS later. Getting the fronts and backgrounds to load were the two hardest aspects of this project for me. It took me many tries to get the backgrounds to load but it was extremely rewarding when I finally got them, it was also a great learning experience and once I fixed one I knew how to fix those issues in the future when they came up. Overall this project was a great experience, it allowed me to improve both my CSS and design skills while also learning to problem-solve and fix issue independently. I am very happy with how my site came out and am excited to work on more sites in the future.
